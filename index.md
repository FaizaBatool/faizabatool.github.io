## How It Works

### Video Upload

The user uploads an educational video through the web interface. The application supports various video formats to ensure compatibility.

### Audio Transcription

Using OpenAI Whisper, the audio from the video is transcribed into text. This step ensures that all spoken content is captured accurately.

### Visual Analysis

The application employs GPT-4 Vision to analyze the visual content of the video. This includes identifying key scenes, objects, and themes.

### Content Structuring

After transcription and analysis, the application organizes the content into modules and lessons. It identifies logical breaks in the video to create a coherent course structure.

### Quiz Generation

To enhance learning, the application generates quizzes based on the content of the modules. These quizzes can be customized and are designed to test comprehension.

### User Interface

The frontend is designed with user experience in mind. It allows users to easily navigate through the generated content and access additional resources.
